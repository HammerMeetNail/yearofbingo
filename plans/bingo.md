# Year of Bingo - Implementation Plan

A web application for creating and tracking annual Bingo cards.

**Domain**: yearofbingo.com

## Overview

Users create a 5x5 Bingo card with 24 personal goals (center square is free). Throughout the year, they mark items complete and track progress. Cards can be shared with friends who can view and react to completions.

---

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Go (net/http, no framework)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis (session storage, rate limiting)
- **Containerization**: Podman (local dev), container images on quay.io
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Deployment**: GitOps (declarative, container-based)

### Infrastructure Cost Estimate
- VPS (2GB RAM): ~$6-12/mo (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or Fly.io)
- Managed PostgreSQL: Free tier or ~$5/mo
- Redis: In-memory on same VPS or free tier (Upstash)
- **Total**: ~$6-15/mo for modest traffic
