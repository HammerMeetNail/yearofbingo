# Feature Flag / Entitlement Implementation Plan

## Purpose

Document the premium feature-entitlement pattern used in this repository so premium features can be shipped independently instead of relying on a single global `is_premium` check.

This document reflects the implementation as of February 6, 2026.

## Current Model

### Backend Entitlement Layer

- File: `internal/services/billing/entitlements.go`
- `Feature` enum values currently include:
  - `templates`
  - `edit_after_finalize`
- `FeatureEntitlements` currently includes:
  - `templates: bool`
  - `edit_after_finalize: bool`
- Entitlement API:
  - `IsPremium(user, now)` returns global premium status.
  - `Features(user, now)` returns per-feature flags.
  - `HasFeature(user, now, feature)` is the server-side gate check.

Current mapping:
- `templates` feature is enabled when:
  - `IsPremium(...)` is true, and
  - `FEATURE_TEMPLATES_ENABLED=true`
- `edit_after_finalize` feature is enabled when:
  - `IsPremium(...)` is true, and
  - `FEATURE_EDIT_AFTER_FINALIZE_ENABLED=true`

### Global Feature Switches (Required)

Every premium feature flag must also support a **global runtime switch** so operators can disable a single premium feature without revoking Premium itself.

Required env vars:
- `FEATURE_TEMPLATES_ENABLED` (default `true`)
- `FEATURE_EDIT_AFTER_FINALIZE_ENABLED` (default `true`)

Evaluation rule for server gating:
- `HasFeature(user, now, feature)` must return `true` **only if both are true**:
  - user entitlement for that feature (`IsPremium(...)` + per-feature mapping)
  - global feature switch for that feature

Behavioral expectations:
- A user can still be `is_premium=true` while one or more feature flags are globally disabled.
- In that state, API `features` should expose the disabled feature(s) as `false` so frontend UX stays consistent.
- Server handlers must continue to use `HasFeature(...)` as the source of truth.

### API Exposure

- Billing status payload (`GET /api/billing/status`) includes:
  - `is_premium`
  - `features` object (`templates`, `edit_after_finalize`)
- Auth payloads include:
  - `is_premium`
  - `features` object (`templates`, `edit_after_finalize`)

Files:
- `internal/services/billing/types.go`
- `internal/services/billing/service.go`
- `internal/handlers/auth.go`
- `internal/handlers/billing.go`

### Templates Gating

Templates are gated by feature flag, not directly by global premium:

- Server handlers use `HasFeature(..., FeatureTemplates)`:
  - `internal/handlers/templates.go`
- Frontend uses feature-aware checks:
  - `App.hasFeature('templates')`
  - `App.requireFeature('templates', ...)`
  - `web/static/js/app.js`

### Edit After Finalize Gating

Edit-after-finalize is gated by feature flag, not directly by global premium:

- Server handler uses `HasFeature(..., FeatureEditAfterFinalize)`:
  - `internal/handlers/card.go`
- Frontend uses feature-aware checks:
  - `App.hasFeature('edit_after_finalize')`
  - `web/static/js/app.js`

## Adding a New Premium Feature Flag

1. Add enum + field in backend entitlement model:
   - `internal/services/billing/entitlements.go`
2. Add global env switch in config (default `true`) and wire startup initialization.
3. Map the new feature in `Features(user, now)` including global switch logic.
4. Gate server endpoints with `HasFeature(...)`.
5. Return feature state through auth and billing responses (already wired to return `features`).
6. Use `App.hasFeature('<feature_name>')` in UI/route/action checks.
7. Add tests for:
   - Entitlement mapping
   - Handler gate behavior
   - Global-switch override behavior (`is_premium=true` but server feature disabled)
   - Frontend route/UI gating behavior
8. Update `web/static/openapi.yaml` with new `features` property schema.

## Guardrail Rules

- Always enforce feature access server-side; frontend checks are UX only.
- Keep free functionality additive-safe (no regressions to existing free workflows).
- Prefer feature-specific checks over broad `is_premium` checks for premium feature surfaces.
- Keep feature names stable and explicit across backend and frontend (`templates`, `ai_enhancements`, etc.).
- Keep global switch env names explicit and stable (`FEATURE_<NAME>_ENABLED`).

## Testing Checklist

- Backend unit tests:
  - `internal/services/billing/entitlements_test.go`
  - Feature-gated handler tests for each premium endpoint.
- Frontend JS tests:
  - Route and navigation gating behavior.
  - Feature entitlement override behavior (`is_premium=true` but feature disabled).
- API contract:
  - `web/static/openapi.yaml` reflects `features` in relevant responses.

## Global AI availability

`FEATURE_AI_ENABLED` defaults to `false` and disables all AI integration, including free wizard/guide generation and premium enhancements. It is read at startup; restart/recreate the app after changing it. `AI_STUB` does not override this switch.

The server registers a JSON 503 response for all six AI routes when disabled, before endpoint authentication, rate limiting, request parsing, or quota consumption (the normal outer security middleware still applies). It does not initialize the AI service. The effective premium AI entitlement is `IsPremium && FEATURE_AI_ENABLED && FEATURE_AI_ENHANCEMENTS_ENABLED`; other premium feature switches are independent.

The HTML shell exposes only the boolean via `data-ai-enabled`, omits the wizard script when disabled, and the UI gates AI entry points. Existing cards, manual editing, curated suggestions, sharing, and billing are unaffected. E2E opts in explicitly to exercise enabled AI with the deterministic stub.
