A web application for creating and tracking annual Bingo cards. Create a Bingo card (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5), fill it with personal goals, then mark items complete throughout the year as you achieve them.

## Features

- Create and customize annual bingo cards (2x2–5x5, optional FREE space)
- Edit via drag/drop (desktop) and touch-friendly interactions (mobile)
- Track progress with optional notes and bingo notifications
- Suggestions + optional AI-assisted goal generation (disabled by default)
- Social features: friends, reactions, share links, and privacy controls
- Archive + export (stats + CSV export)
- Email auth flows (verification, magic links, reset password)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24+ with net/http (no frameworks)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript SPA with hash-based routing
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+
- **Cache/Sessions**: Redis 7+
- **Containerization**: Podman/Docker with Compose

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Podman Compose or Docker Compose

### Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HammerMeetNail/yearofbingo.git
cd yearofbingo

# Start the application
make local
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

### Development

A `Makefile` provides convenient commands for common tasks:

```bash
# Full local rebuild: stop, build assets, build container, start
make local

# View container logs
make logs

# Stop containers
make down

# Run linting (requires golangci-lint)
make lint

# Run all tests in container (wraps ./scripts/test.sh)
make test

# Check code coverage
make coverage

# Clean up everything including volumes (full reset, destructive)
make clean
```

### Testing

Tests run in containers to match the production environment:

```bash
# Run all tests (Go + JavaScript)
make test

# Run Go-only / JS-only
make test-backend
make test-frontend
```

Or run locally:

```bash
# Go tests
go test ./...

# JavaScript tests (requires Node.js, no npm dependencies)
node web/static/js/tests/runner.js
```

#### E2E (Playwright)

Playwright runs in a container (no npm install on the host) and uses Mailpit (SMTP) for email flows.

```bash
# Full E2E run (destructive: resets volumes, reseeds data)
make e2e

# Headed mode / debug helpers
make e2e-headed
make e2e-debug

# Desktop browser matrix plus Pixel/iPhone emulation
make e2e BROWSERS=firefox,chromium,webkit,mobile-chromium,mobile-webkit
```

Artifacts:
- HTML report: `playwright-report/`
- Raw results: `test-results/`

Notes:
- E2E explicitly enables `FEATURE_AI_ENABLED=true` with `AI_STUB=1` so AI wizard tests are deterministic (no network/API keys). To test the disabled application, run `FEATURE_AI_ENABLED=false ./scripts/e2e.sh ai-disabled.spec.js`.
- Specs live in `tests/e2e/*.spec.js` (with shared helpers in `tests/e2e/helpers.js`).
- For a current “coverage map” of workflows, see `plans/playwright.md`.
- Mobile projects cover touch navigation, card editing/completion, AI gating, and drag behavior; see `agent_docs/testing.md` for the native-input and emulation details.

## AI availability

AI is temporarily disabled by default through `FEATURE_AI_ENABLED=false`. This blocks every AI endpoint before provider calls or usage accounting, hides AI controls, and skips loading the wizard script. Manual cards, curated suggestions, sharing, and other Premium features remain available.

To restore AI, set `FEATURE_AI_ENABLED=true` in the deployment environment and recreate/restart the app. Configure `GEMINI_API_KEY` for real generation; `AI_STUB=1` is only for deterministic tests and never overrides the global switch. Premium AI additionally requires `FEATURE_AI_ENHANCEMENTS_ENABLED=true` and the user's Premium entitlement.

Local Compose database, Redis, mail, and mock service ports bind to `127.0.0.1`; containers still communicate over the Compose network. The app remains accessible on port 8080. Container builds exclude `.env` files; supply secrets through the runtime environment.

## Documentation

- API docs: `/api/docs` (Swagger UI) and `web/static/openapi.yaml`
- Architectural notes and “how we work”: `agent_docs/`
- Feature specs and implementation notes: `plans/`

## Configuration

Configuration is via environment variables (see `.env.example`). For local development, Compose files (`compose.yaml`, `compose.prod.yaml`) provide sensible defaults.

Set `DEBUG=true` to enable debug-level logs. In `APP_ENV=development`, this may log Gemini prompt/response text during AI requests; don’t enable in production.

## Scripts

Helper scripts live in `scripts/` (generally API-driven; many require `curl` + `jq`). Common entrypoints:

- `./scripts/test.sh` (used by `make test`; supports flags like `--coverage`, `--go`, `--js`)
- `./scripts/seed.sh` (seed local dev data)
- `./scripts/build-assets.sh` (build content-hashed frontend assets)

## CI/CD

CI runs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) and exercises lint, unit/integration tests, and container builds. Release notes/process live in `agent_docs/ops.md`.

## Security & Performance

- **Security Headers**: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **HTTPS**: HSTS enabled when `SERVER_SECURE=true`
- **Compression**: Gzip for text responses
- **Caching**: Content-hashed assets cached immutably (1 year); API responses not cached
- **Logging**: Structured JSON request logs with timing and status

## Accessibility

- Skip links for keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus visible styles for keyboard users
- Reduced motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
- OpenDyslexic font for improved readability
