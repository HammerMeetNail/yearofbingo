### API Access

Programmatic access is available via Bearer tokens.

1. Generate a token in your Profile settings
2. Use the token in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer yob_abc...`
3. Full interactive documentation available at `/api/docs`

## Scripts

Development and testing scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory. All scripts use the API (not direct database access) and require `curl` and `jq`.

### seed.sh

Seeds the database with test data for development and testing.

```bash
# Use default URL (http://localhost:8080)
./scripts/seed.sh

# Use custom URL
./scripts/seed.sh http://localhost:3000
```

**Creates:**
- 3 test users with password `Password1`:
  - `alice@test.com` (Alice Anderson)
  - `bob@test.com` (Bob Builder)
  - `carol@test.com` (Carol Chen)
- Alice's cards:
  - 2025: 6/24 completed (current year)
  - 2024: 18/24 completed, 2 bingos (archived)
  - 2023: 12/24 completed, 1 bingo (archived)
- Bob's cards:
  - 2025: 6/24 completed (current year)
  - 2024: 24/24 completed, 12 bingos - perfect year! (archived)
- Friendships: Alice ↔ Bob (accepted), Carol → Alice (pending)
- Emoji reactions from Bob on Alice's completed items

**Idempotent behavior:** If users/cards already exist, the script logs in and fetches existing data rather than failing.

### cleanup.sh

Removes friendships and reactions for test accounts via the API.

```bash
# Use default URL (http://localhost:8080)
./scripts/cleanup.sh

# Use custom URL
./scripts/cleanup.sh http://localhost:3000
```

**Note:** User accounts and cards remain after cleanup (no delete API). For a complete reset:

```bash
podman compose down -v && podman compose up
```

### test-archive.sh

Tests the archive and statistics endpoints.

```bash
# Use default URL (http://localhost:8080)
./scripts/test-archive.sh

# Use custom URL
./scripts/test-archive.sh http://localhost:3000
```

**Tests:**
- `GET /api/cards/archive` - Lists cards from past years
- `GET /api/cards/{id}/stats` - Card statistics including completion rate and bingo count

**Note:** Archive only shows cards from past years. Cards created by `seed.sh` (2025) won't appear in archive until 2026.

### build-assets.sh

Generates content-hashed filenames for CSS and JavaScript files, enabling aggressive caching without stale asset issues.

```bash
./scripts/build-assets.sh
```

**Output:**
- Creates hashed files in `web/static/dist/` (e.g., `styles.08535cc8.css`)
- Generates `manifest.json` mapping original paths to hashed versions
- Hashed assets are served with immutable cache headers (1 year)

**Note:** This script runs automatically during container builds. The Go server reads the manifest and injects hashed paths into HTML templates.

### Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:
1. Use the API, not direct database access
2. Include a header comment explaining purpose and usage
3. Support a custom base URL as the first argument
4. Use the shared patterns: `get_csrf()`, `login_user()`, `logout_user()`
5. Log to stderr (`>&2`) so function return values aren't polluted
6. Handle "already exists" cases gracefully for idempotency

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Lint** - Code quality checks with golangci-lint
2. **Test (Go)** - Unit tests with race detection and coverage
3. **Test (JS)** - Frontend JavaScript tests
4. **Build** - Compile Go binary
5. **Build & Scan Image** - Build container, run Trivy security scan
6. **Push** - Push to container registry (only after scan passes)

### Container Images

Multi-architecture images (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64) are published to [quay.io/yearofbingo/yearofbingo](https://quay.io/repository/yearofbingo/yearofbingo):
- `quay.io/yearofbingo/yearofbingo:latest` - Latest main branch build
- `quay.io/yearofbingo/yearofbingo:<sha>` - Specific commit builds

### Running the Production Image

```bash
# Run the production image from quay.io
podman compose -f compose.prod.yaml up

# Or with Docker
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml up
```

This pulls the pre-built image from quay.io and runs it with local PostgreSQL and Redis containers.

### Running CI Locally

```bash
# Run linting (requires golangci-lint)
golangci-lint run

# Run all tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Build container image locally
podman build -f Containerfile -t yearofbingo .
```

### Secret Scanning

The repository uses [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to prevent accidentally committing secrets:

- **Pre-commit hook**: Scans staged files before each commit
- **CI check**: Scans all changes in pull requests and pushes

To set up the pre-commit hook after cloning:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (macOS)
brew install pre-commit

# Or with pip
pip install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install
```

Gitleaks will now run automatically on every `git commit`. To test manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Path Filtering

To avoid unnecessary builds and deploys, the CI pipeline uses path filtering:

- **Always runs**: Secret scanning (gitleaks)
- **Only on code changes**: Lint, test, build, and deploy jobs

Documentation-only changes (README, markdown files, etc.) will not trigger builds or deployments.

## Security & Performance

- **Security Headers**: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **HTTPS**: HSTS enabled when `SERVER_SECURE=true`
- **Compression**: Gzip for text responses
- **Caching**: Content-hashed assets cached immutably (1 year); API responses not cached
- **Logging**: Structured JSON request logs with timing and status

## Accessibility

- Skip links for keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus visible styles for keyboard users
- Reduced motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
- OpenDyslexic font for improved readability
